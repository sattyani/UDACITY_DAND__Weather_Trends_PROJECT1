# Udacity DAND Project1 - Explore Weather Trends
Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Project 01 - Exploring Weather Trends using SQL, jupyter notebook based on python, numpy, and Pandas libraries
# Description
Analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live (Riyadh / Saudi Arabia) to overall global temperature trends.
* Create visualization using maptplotlib library
* Prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where I live (Riyadh - Saudi Arabia)

# Steps
* **Data Extraction**: Extract data using SQL for global average as well as Riyadh into two csv file.
*  **Data analysis, manipulation** using Jupyter notebook, python, numpy and pandas
*  **Data Visualization**: using matplotlib
*  **Observations**: list of observations about similarities and differences between the two charts.
# Files
* `Project 1 weather trends report.pdf`: A complete report containing full details on the SQL queries used to extract data as well as python coding, approach and steps used to prepare data and generate visulization
* `Project 1 weather trends.ipynb` : similar to the pdf file, this file is in jupyter notebook output
* `results global data.csv`: Export file for global weather data and trends
*  `results riyadh.csv`: Export file for Riyadh weather data and trends
*  `riyadh_global average.csv`: Combined global and local city temperature in one csv file “riyadh_global average.cvs”
*  `line chart.png`: the final chart of weather trends globablly and in Riyadh"# Udacity_DAND_CaseStudy1-Investigate_Weather_Trends_Data_Set"
